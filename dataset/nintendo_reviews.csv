3.0 out of 5 stars,A much needed Critical Analysis,,"Im not sure how popular this review will be but not many people seem to mention the negative points of the Switch so I thought I would go over some criticisms.THE BOXI actually like the design of the Box/Packaging in this new v2 model. Bright red with the black Nintendo switch in view. I know its just a box but it looks eye catching. If I saw it in a store as a kid I can imagine it standing out more than the PS4 or Xbox.Everything is neatly and compactly packed inside however the console itself is just placed in a plastic bag. There is no protective film over the screen and upon looking over mine with a fine toothcomb I noticed a tiny scratch under good lighting. Its not noticeable enough to return it but an annoyance on a brand new console.Would it have been so hard for Nintendo to cover the screen with a protective film or even ship it with a screen protector attached? Lots of phone manufacturers are doing that nowadays.THE CONSOLEFrom the front with no JoyCons connected it could be an Amazon Fire Tablet for anyone knows. Im surprised they didn't put any Nintendo branding on the front somewhere. There's certainly enough Bezel to put a logo at the top or bottom. The back has the Nintendo branding and logo however.The touchscreen is made from plastic which is somewhat surprising as Phones and Tablets have been using glass for years now. At the same time I get why they did it, a lot of kids are going to be using this and glass shatters a lot easier when dropped but it does lack that premium feel with plastic.The display is of the LCD variety so don't go expecting OLED quality. I say that because with everyone using high end smartphones and tablets these days we are so accustomed to a certain standard of quality. You may end up thinking ""huh this game would look a lot better on my phone"" and if you own a flagship such as the iPhone, Samsung or OnePlus you'd be right.The kickstand is something I will never use. You really need to be at a table or desk at an appropriate height or you're going to end up with neck and eyestrain. And to me it doesn't seem sturdy enough, the surface needs to be flat and you better make sure no one is around to accidentally knock it over. I'm not taking risks with a £300 console.If im going to nitpick the game cartridge cover could have been made better too. Its made from flexible plastic that bends backwards when you open it. Over time I can see that braking off then you're left with a large opening for dust to sink down into.THE DOCKOhboy lets start buy saying if you need to purchase a second one for whatever reason they retail at £80. This blows my mind. Because as you'll see when unpackaging it, its nothing more than a piece of light brittle plastic with a Nintendo logo on. There's some basic circuitry inside for the HDMI and power connection but nothing justifies that price. You may as well just start selling me cardboard for the same price Nintendo. Oh wait... Nintendo DO sell cardboard in the form of their Labo kits which cost anywhere between £40-£50 each. I don't know how someone can justify paying this amount for cardboard. The markup Nintendo makes on these kits must be outstanding. But its all about the Nintendo Quality right?QUALITY CONTROLThis must be the most poorly thought out and built Nintendo console yet. While at a surface level everything seems fine after owning it for a few days you notice some undesirable quirks.Docking the switch feels clumsy like you have to carefully move it down into place so as to not cause any damage. You don't want to just casually let it drop in because you have a USB Type-C port on the bottom and it doesn't require much force to damage these. Constantly docking the console over time is going to wear that port out if you're not careful then you could end up with intermittent charging or TV connection issues. In addition to that a number of people have reported the dock scratching their console when docking and undocking. This is because the touchscreen is made from plastic and the dock is made from a matte feeling scratchy plastic. Nintendo didn't even bother to put some soft material on the guide rails inside so people are actually selling little strips of fabric on Ebay as a solution to this. Just ridiculous. It also wobbles about when touched in the dock position (For example pressing the power key)What was stopping Nintendo from designing it so the console slides in smoothly with some soft material on the inside to protect the touchscreen and make the console sit flush and secure? At £80 for the dock that should be expected at the very least.You connect the cables behind a flap on the dock and feed them through a hole at the bottom. Why are the ports above this opening so the cables have to bend downwards putting tension on the connections for no reason. I know that's nitpicking to the extreme but its like connecting your phone to a charger and pulling on the cable in the opposite direction constantly just causing unnecessary wear over time. Again I wouldn't care if a replacement dock didn't cost £80!WIFIThe WiFi signal is atrocious because Nintendo has decided to be cheap and use an inferior WiFi chip when making the console. These things aren't even that expensive for a quality WiFi  chip so I just don't understand why they would do this especially when the console has no ethernet connection. Many people receive just one bar of signal even when 2 feet from their router. This impacts download speeds and Online Multiplayer connection.joyCONSThe Con part they got right. Retail Price between £65 and £80 if you want a fancy colour (For reference a Dual Shock 4 Controller for the PS4 costs around £40-£45.Again perhaps this would be forgivable if they were built well but there are endless complaints of drift issues with the analogue sticks after just a few months (Drift meaning when not even being touched during gameplay the game thinks they are so causes the camera or character to move unintentionally rendering the controllers useless)On top of this the Bluetooth connection is poor and they are susceptible to random disconnects. It was said Nintendo had moved the antennas to fix this issue but even on this v2 console I had a disconnect just the other day.Some solutions Nintendo provide is to keep your console away from other consoles, devices that use WiFi, speakers, cables... Basically if you want them to work flawlessly you need a laboratory environment. Again utterly ridiculous. How can we accept this poor quality when the PS4 and Xbox controllers are cheaper and have almost Zero issues?ACCESSORIESOnly with Nintendo consoles will you find an endless amount of accessories either from Nintendo themselves or third party manufacturers.Nintendo generally sell anything to further cash in on consumers such as the plastic steering wheels, Labo kits or their new upcoming plastic hoop which appears to be trying to recreate the success of the Wii Fit. It should be noted that none of these products contain any functional technology. All the guts of what makes them work is in the JoyCon controllers  you already own which feature a range of sensors such as accelerometers, gyro sensors and motion cameras. Basically you're buying plastic junk. Some people are ok with that but im not into it.The third party manufacturers on the other hand often sell accessories to solve problems with the console that shouldn't be there in the first place. To name a few..Screen Protectors - Nintendo don't supply any with the console so be sure to purchase one if you buy the SwitchThird Party Docks - Retail much cheaper than the official Nintendo Dock however I do not recommend them. Third party manufacturers often use inferior components and If its something that's going to be directly connecting to your Switch there's the possibility of it bricking your console.Dock Sock - A piece of fabric that covers the Switch Dock to prevent the screen from scratching when dockingPower Banks - An additional large battery that can be used to charge your console. Useful for people who like to play in handheld mode a lot.Stands - Various stands designed to prop up the Switch more securely than the flimsy kickstand is capable of with more adjustability.Im sure there's many more but I would be here all day.WHATS THE REAL PRICE OF THE SWITCH?You're likely going to spend more than £280 if you buy a Switch. The first reason being the Switch only comes with 32GB of storage of which only 25GB of that is available. For reference games like Doom and Skyrim on the Switch are pushing 20GB in download size each if you purchase them digitally on the eshop. So you've already used up all your storage on one game.This next one is debatable but one could argue that the Pro Controller sold separately is a must if you intend to do any serious gaming or play online. The JoyCons just don't cut it when it comes to precision and comfort, the buttons are small and the analogue sticks have such a small movement area that playing any kind of online shooter would be a nightmare. So now you need the console, an SD Card, a screen protector, a controller and lets go crazy and say you perhaps want a game with it too. Lets do the math.Nintendo Switch Console £280Screen Protector £10128GB SanDisk SD Card around £20Pro Controller £60Mario Odyssey £40Total £410For comparison i purchased my PS4 in 2015 for £290 and that came with The Witcher 3 Free. Even better Amazon are currently selling a PS4 bundle with Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted and The Last of Us all for £270. You'd pay half that price just buying 3 Nintendo games alone.Its somewhat questionable when the most underpowered console is the most expensive to buy..THE USER INTERFACEThis could really use some work. The console has been out for 2 years now and the design of the Main home screen is looking dated. No real changes appear to have been made since release. The icons along the bottom look like they could have been from a late 90s computer programme. Not to mention the complete silence of the home screen.Im so used to the PS4 booting up with the ambient theme music that I thought I had the sound muted initially but no there just isn't any. Its a small detail but hearing that music before you start a game really puts you in the zone. Its a cue to forget anything else going on in your life and just chill out for a few hours. Does anyone remember the iconic PsOne boot up sound? That ominous music as you turned on your console was some great sound design.With the Switch its like booting up into a void of emptiness. It doesn't set any kind of atmosphere, nothing is drawing me in to start up that new game other than the urge to get off the silent home screen as quick as possible. There's no real personality or identity to it. Maybe im getting too metaphysical for a console review but something definitely feels missing.The only option you have is to choose a white or dark theme which as you would expect does nothing more than change the background colour. Its in serious need of some personalization. I've heard the DS has an endless amount of Themes to choose from so why Nintendo hasn't implemented anything like this in 2 years for the Switch is mind boggling.GAMES & DEMOGRAPHICSince the days of the Original Wii console Nintendo have focussed on appealing to the more casual gamers going so far as to extend their marketing to an older generation who may have never thought about owning a console with the release of the Wii Fit. At the same time maintaining their core fanbase with regular releases of Nintendo classics that everyone loves.With the Switch it looks like they aim to build on this further with their upcoming ""Ring Fit"" which appears to be a Pilates Ring which you can strap some Joycons to. In addition to this the portability of the Switch makes it popular with kids and teens. In other words Nintendo seems to be trying to cover all bases and its paying off for them as the console Is selling really well.Its definitely a console you could take out at a party and get everyone involved. There's several party games on the Switch that are easily accessible to even the most inexperienced player.There's also a huge selection of first party exclusive games suitable for kids - Mario, Mario Kart, Donkey Kong etc.Where it falls behind in comparison to the PS4 would be in story driven single player games and mature content. While the Switch has some titles aimed at an older audience such as Astral Chain and Bayonetta these games seem to have a heavy Japanese influence and the style of them may not be for everyone. I don't even think Nintendo are trying to compete with Sony in this area, they are taking a different path. Definitely worth thinking about when purchasing as there is a distinct difference between the two consoles and types of games you will be playing. My preference leans more towards Sony when I want to get into a good story driven game.GRAPHICSIn terms of graphics very little has improved from their previous console the Wii U. In fact comparing Zelda Breath of The Wild on the Wii U and Switch they appear to look almost identical. The Switch can output a max resolution of 1080p when docked depending on the game. This does leave it trailing behind the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X which both support 4k resolutions. This noticeable difference in performance will only be amplified in a few months time when the PlayStation 5 and new Xbox console are released. The Switch will be so far behind the competition at that point it makes me wonder how much support Nintendo will get from third party developers.However I will say what the Switch lacks in graphical power it makes up for in art design. Games like Zelda and Astral Chain look stunning and really push the console to its limits. Quite impressive when you consider its small form factor and portability.THE NINTENDO TAXNintendo games have always been more expensive than their competitors. As a kid it was often impossible to get a brand new N64 game for Christmas because even then the prices were pushing £60 on some titles. My parents could never justify paying that amount for one game especially back in those days so would often buy Pre-Owned to save a few pounds and i'd get a game in a squashed crumpled box because Nintendo sold their games in cardboard packaging back then for some reason.Fast forward several console generations later and it appears this tradition is still going. A good example is Super Mario Bros on the DS. This game was released way back in 2006 and is still being sold on Amazon and GAME new for £30-£40. Cheaper than at release im sure but for a 13 year old game its held its price pretty damn well.A more recent example would be Zelda Breath of the Wild. This game is 2 years old and is still being sold at full price £47.99 on Amazon. Even crazier GAME sell it Pre-Owned for the same price they sell it new. I could quite easily go into a rant about why I hate GAME stores right now but this review is already too long. Needless to say that example is just one of many of GAME stores trying to rip customers off.Also consider the fact a lot of the Switches games are just ports from the Wii U. To name a few.. Bayonetta, Donkey Kong, Hyrule Warriors, Mario Kart 8, Zelda. Don't expect the price to be any cheaper on that basis however.This only emphasises my point earlier that the Switch is an expensive console to own. You're never going to be able to pick up a first party title for half price if you wait a few years. Sony is a lot more forgiving in this regard and you can often find their exclusives selling for £15-£20 after a couple of years.CONCLUSIONI've always had the same problem with Nintendo consoles. I get hooked into buying them because of that one great game they have -  Zelda, Metroid, Super Smash Bros etc. But after im done with those what's left to choose from never quite reaches that same level of greatness. For playing single player games only it can fall a bit short in comparison to Sony who are constantly developing amazing story driven experiences - God Of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last Of Us, Uncharted, Bloodborne, Death Stranding. Admittedly catering to an older audience.The Switch has the fun factor on its side however. Getting the whole family involved in a party game at Christmas, wirelessly connecting your Switch with a group of friends for some local multiplayer gaming or taking the console with you on long trips will all be big draws to some. Nintendo are probably the most accommodating to a younger audience also.Ultimately It comes down to personal preference. There's a lot to like but a lot where Nintendo should be trying harder to keep pace with Sony and Microsoft. With the Failure of the Wii U console it seems they may have rushed the Switch out the door resulting in a console which isn't quite as refined as it should be. Combined with a smaller library of games and limited third party support it doesn't quite meet the mark for a perfect score.And that's my review of the Nintendo Switch. I salute you if you made it to the end.Full disclosure I purchased my console from Argos as the deal was £300 with a game. I also have no bias to either Nintendo, PlayStation or Xbox and have owned all 3 in some iteration over the years.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 September 2019

   I have been looking to buy the Nintendo Switch for some time, but held off as I knew a new version would come out.This version, model number HAC-001(-01), has the same battery as the original Switch, but the CPU is now more efficient. This is why battery life is around double of what the original system offered.In the box you will get:* Nintendo Switch tablet* Joy-Con Controllers* Joy-Con straps* Nintendo Switch Dock* AC Power Adapter (with type C connection)* Nintendo-branded HDMI cable* ManualApart from the new model number being displayed in the back, this new version looks identical to the original. As such, it will work with all original Nintendo controllers, cases, screen protectors, and other accessories.I've played the Switch a lot at my friend's house. It's a great system. You can play on the move, with friends on a train, or on your television using the docking station. This makes it a better option than the lite in my opinion, particularly as battery life is longer.Recommended.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Newest model/version [Updated],,"[Update Oct 2020]Approximately a year after purchase, the left joycon (controller) would start disconnecting/reconnecting and the joystick failed to ""register"" properly in one direction.  This was shipped to Nintendo's UK Service Centre and repaired, completely free of charge.  Note it was within 12 months and therefore within warranty, though I was still quite pleased at the simplicity and convenience of the repair service.Aside from that, everything's still great, and I'll admit I've dropped it a couple times![Original Review]Newest model/version with double battery life, get this over the other unless you care for the £30 voucher, as this does NOT come with a voucher.Personally, I'd recommend getting this and buying your games as physical copies, as they're cheaper that way and have the resale value/aspect too.  You can also buy games in used condition, as they're not like discs where they scratch - they're perfectly fine.Not used much as of yet, though it came with 50% battery charge, and controller charges of approx. 75%.Display is bright and consistent, no faults such as dead pixels, on my unit at least.Device is well packaged, with components individually wrapped in protective bags and/or bubble wrap.  Whilst it may not be very environmentally friendly, they do help protect the items somewhat, and are very easy to remove.Does not come with a screen protector, at all.Entire box itself came packaged within a standard Amazon-branded box - perfect if hiding from a gift recipient.Includes a HDMI cable, appears to be 1m long.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2019

5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun in a box!,Verified Purchase,"Where to begin?This console has been my first in a while, the last being a PS2. Growing up on NES and SNES and N64 has probably engendered some Nintendo bias my way but a PS1,PS2 and an Xbone have also resided under my roof too at various points!The console is a bit expensive and the games aren't cheap either. That being said there are some decent indie games on the online store and a lot of the games have high amounts of replayability/game time so from that perspective present great value for money.The switch is made better by the addition of people - friends preferably! It is clearly meant for multiplayer applications but equally is comfortable as a portable gameboy-esque device for solo, on the go, play as well.Considering its size and hardware the performance is excellent. The game library has more interesting offerings to me compared to the first-person-shooter obsession that seems to exist on xbone/ps4.I will reiterate - it *is* expensive considering its size etc and the fact that you'll probably need a controller or two and a memory card and probably a carrying bag as well as games. However it's not something I regret getting and have been having immense fun with it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic, would have been hard to survive lockdown without this",Verified Purchase,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
  
  
    
   This was a birthday present to the 5 year old, that came at the right time for us, as we are spending lockdown in a rather small flat, with three kids.Before I describe the specs of the Switch, I'd like to explain why this was selected instead of the Switch Light or the more expensive PS or Xbox.Our older kids are 5 and 6, which is almost the age when they can ""do it themselves"", but not quite there yet. The operation functions of Nintendo Switch are easily learnt, the kids can set it up themselves and the variety of games Nintendo offers is often in the right mind for children this age - i.e. not so sophisticated or complicated that they would need an adult's help. The Switch Light is a good option of course, especially for a kid with no siblings, but without the ability to hook the console to the tv, it's going to be harder to turn this into a multi participation venue, i.e. only one kids at a time.With the Nintendo Switch, we often see the kids opt for TV game mode, and we can all participate in active games such as ""Just Dance"" or ""Tokyo 2020 Olympics"", which the game rewards them through actual movement.Why not PS or Xbox? Well, they're more expensive and as described above sophisticated. So, if you have a very technical child of 10+ maybe they are the better option. For us, the fact that they can hook up the controller themselves and the games are plain and simple was the selling point.What's in the box?===============The Switch condole, a tv hookup hub, a charging cable, 2 Joy Cons (note - 2 Joy Cons makes one whole controller in essence, and some games would require them as such, i.e. you need both per user), and one Joy Con Grip (to combine them to one controller).Game modes:============- The solo mode, as seen on the second picture/the video, provides the kids hours of fun on their own.- The TV hookup (photo 3)1) You can play solo with a big screen. Easy to setup - you just need an empty socket near the tv and an HDMI connection. You then can use the two Joy-Con's with the the controller hub that comes with the switch.2) Another option (for games which allow it) is to use each Joy-Con as a solo controller. The Joy-Cons are gyroscopic and feel the hand movement, so you can play ""Just Dance"" or ""Mario Kart"" by moving your hands around. they even provide feedback in terms of vibrations, and remind of the old Wii consoles.- Detaching the JoyCons and using the console as a small screen, this is the worst option but it works too, there's a small leg that allows the console to stand upright (but it tends to fall off, a bit of a design flaw that is negligible since this game mode is not the best anyways).To sum up all the Pro's: hours of fun, interactive games which will keep the kids fit not just in 'zombie' mode, dual game mode as mentioned and adequate for kids up from the age of 5 to setup on their own.To add to that: there are dozens of game around, with genres that fit just about anyone.Con's:=====Not all is perfect with the Nintendo Switch and here are some faults and the way to overcome them (if applicable):- The games are expensive. A new game is around £40, which is not optimal when you want the kids to have a variety. Also, if you bought a game that they didn't like/can't handle - that's money down the toilet.Luckily, the Nintendo Shop has previous and free periods that allow you to test games (but we don't really bother with these).- The Switch comes with two Joy Cons. If you want to play more than two people you will have to get another set, and another grip. while this is relatively cheap, you will then want a charging dock, so you won't have to rotate between them, and it doesn't really end...- You would probably want a screen protector, a travel case, and a few more games... so again when it comes to costs, add at least £100-150 to the original price (and prob more).- The worst thing is the need to subscribe to the Nintendo Shop to be able to play online multi games in several games. this is downright infuriating, as you need to pay for something you already paid for. However, we found that we enjoy the games without the online option as it is.Good games to start with:=====================- Animal Crossings New Horizons - especially for calmer kids who likes building and strategy.- Mario Kart - this is brilliant, the superlatives this game has received are very just, it provides several game modes and hours of fun for all of the family (I enjoy playing with the kids myself, and we get quite competitive)- Just Dance - a good workout in form of dancing with the Joy Cons which will provide hours of fun, but each participant needs a JoyCon.Hope this helped someone to decide whether to get one or not. and If not - feel free to ask questions or comment, or vote this 'helpful' if indeed it was. Thanks and Game on!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2021
5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally handheld gaming that doesn't leave you feeling short changed,Verified Purchase,"I have had many of the previous handheld consoles, but the games always left me feeling I have been short changed compared to their home console version (even the PS Vita which, despite having so much potential, ended up having  the Nintendo 3DS version of ports). The reviews of Witcher 3 sold the Nintendo Switch to me and I enjoy it on the Switch as much as my first play through on the X Box One S.In the 5 months I have had the Switch, I have only played it docked once (on my first day just to check it worked). I choose the Switch over Switch Lite for the following reasons:1. There is a lot of internet comment about the joy stick drifting, so I thought having detachable joy cons will make it easier to replace any faulty joystick. (No drifting in over 5 months of ownership)2. Bigger screen3. Longer battery life4.

No messing around - switch it on and start playing.Positives:Games load quickly, no messing around with installations, just plug in the game and start playing. This is why I moved to console gaming in the first place. If you have limited time for gaming you just want to switch on and play.You can take it with you - or if your significant other wants to watch the telly you can pick it up and play anyway.

I get the drift problem that people talk about, they are fine for using when out and about though. You can pick up good quality third party game controller for switch fairly cheaply - so not a major problem.The games are expensive compared to other consoles.Graphics not as good as other consoles; they are not terrible, just not as good as PS4 or Xbox 1.

2.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrating & completely unintuitive,Verified Purchase,"I'm 43 with two young sons. I'm not a technophobe, though I can't pretend to be a gamer by any stretch of the imagination. My sons have been using an Xbox 360 for the last 6-9 months and love it. It's easy to use, intuitive and just works.This, however, is another story, and I'm already regretting my purchase (my sons are loving it, despite my exasperation, so doubt I'll tear it out of their hands, put it back in its box and request a refund!).Why? Well, first of all, you have to go through a 7 part process to simply connect the two controllers so they work independently (i.e. for two players, rather than together for one). With one game, once that process was done, it all worked OK (Lego Incredibles). However, when I then loaded in Lego City, and went through the same arduous process of pairing the controllers so both boys could play, it kept reverting to one player?! I've still no idea why, and there seems to be no obvious answer (though, I'd welcome the help, if someone can clarify!).There does indeed seem to be some basic design flaws too. To have your main console drop down onto a flimsy USB C connector is surely a recipe for disaster. And while I know I can be careful when docking, whether my 5 year old will be the same is another question.If anyone has any advice on any of the above (addressing some possible blindspots I may have), I'd welcome the feedback. But, if you're like me and just want a games console that's simple to use, I'd steer clear.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2019

At first I was dying all the time couldn't get a grip with controls but after a few months I'm progressing well don't die anymore. I also purchased as pro controller from nintendo and that's awesome too and totally worth the money as I tried the cheap pro controller s and just wasted more money than just buying the Nintendo pro controller in the first place and Amazon have it 6 pounds cheaper than elsewhere I found my game play improved with the pro controller. This is a fantastic console even my friend that has a PlayStation got one as he loved the game play the simple way you can just take it out the cradle and you have hand held game to take away with you. I find it such a versatile console that suits my needs perfectly. It was easy to set up and easy to set the nintendo switch account to I'm not the most tech savvy person but I managed all of this myself very intuitive controls also can not say the fact you use the cons as individual controlles for two player games and use the screen as your TV is great .,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,Switch (newer model) review,Verified Purchase,"Amazing console. The handheld has a larger screen than I expected (previously owned a PS Vita) and it plays great. Although the screen is ""only"" 720p it really looks beautiful, playing Ori and the Blind Forest everything is sharp and detailed. I own a 4k TV so when docked it does look a little less sharp, but still fine. Great library of games that are a little different from hard-core games like COD etc, but this is the best thing about the console. Mario, Zelda, Japanese style games are the best there is, and there's some great updated games from the Wii U like mario Kart deluxe and Tokyo sessions.If you like playing games anywhere, on the bus or in bed or if someone is using the TV then this is for you!The price is quite high for a handheld £279.99 is the normal price, but the games and portability  justify the price.Great battery life on this newer model, it lasts over 7? hours playing some so no problems there.The dock is smaller that I expected and fits next to or behind the TV and takes up no room at all compared to the other consoles, ps4 pro and xbox.The console when docked feels a little loose, it doesn't ""click"" in when docked so don't move it around or mishandled it and you'll be fine.Other things to note- how do you know if you're getting the improved battery life version? It's the model number on the back of the switch, and also the box art. The model ends with a (-001) in brackets at the end which is the newer version, and the box art is Red coloured on the front.Overall brilliant console and a great way to enjoy gaming at home or anywhere. 5 star rating",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2020

5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it's price and online services save you money 6 years makes it less costly overall,Verified Purchase,"Bought this because of having social anxiety issues, so having a console that's two in one helps, and the price to pay online is actually cheaper than the other consoles at war, a year for them is a full priced game, switch... £<20 so you could pay for three years for the price of the war locked others, think of how much savings you make for the three years value... It's a hundred quid roughly",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worth the money, great birthday present",Verified Purchase,It definitely worth the money I bought it for. I bought on Black Friday last year so I have had the Nintendo switch for about 5 months and it has great quality on the screen very clear and easy to use and also you will have to step up an account first as well but it is easy to do. When you connect to the tv you do you get an HMI lead with and it comes with its plug and it's a docking station for the tv so it easy to step up and the quality on the tv is amazing it is really good quality for me.

3.0 out of 5 stars,Second hand switch for nearly £350 ?!?!,Verified Purchase,"Not going to lie the delivery process said it was going to take a while and it came it 2 days!!! I was a bit shocked at the price but I was desperate for one so I was willing to pay the price. When it came I was baffled because the box was small so I didn’t think it was the switch, when I inboxed it I immediately knew I had payed for a second hand switch, the joycons had scratches on the back and were dirty. The dock was dusty and dirty and had obvious signs of wear and tear. All in all it works but I had some trouble with it connecting to the internet as it would connect and disconnect randomly!  I’m just a bit annoyed that it was second hand and for nearly £350!! They’re cheaper brand new, but everywhere is out of stock :( I’m disappointed by what I got compared to the reviews as all the ones I saw came like they would brand new and it says nowhere in the description that second hand options are available only new ones so I would like to honestly know why I received a second hand one 🤷🏼‍♀️",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2020

You can also play a library of classic NES games anytime, anywhere with added online features along with saving your game date to the cloud, This is all with one subscription which you do have to buy separate.Overall this is a fantastic console and well worth the price.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 November 2020

Unique, smooth and magnificent.Whatever the way we choose to play, either on the small or big screen, with joy cons or pro controller, it's always great fun.Beside the fact that it's fantastically nostalgic, it's also a brand new experience with excellent graphics, speed and sound. It also has a powerful battery and a really wide variety of games.I know that it's a real late review, but if I had the time before, I would've get it sooner.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Yep they are the only really good gaming option for younger kids and adults alike.,Verified Purchase,Yes they are awesome. I think you knew that already though. Slightly disappointing to see the price being hiked so much on these right now during the pandemic as I guess they are in high demand. They are now double what I paid in early March and thats for a used one and mine was brand new direct from Amazon. On a side note Amazon did well to deliver this to me well before the expected date originally stated.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2020

I would really recommend for all age groups! Just make sure you order a game to play as well as the free games aren’t the greatest as I found out while waiting for animal crossing to arrive 😅 My only criticism was the fact that amazon hiked up the price due to popular demand which was a shame.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2020

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Console,Verified Purchase,"Well this has been an absolute lifesaver during the pandemic. I haven't left my house in 7 weeks and I was lucky enough to get hold a switch in early April, after trying to get one all through March for my birthday. I'm so glad I did as during this time, being able to play Animal Crossing has been something to look forward to during these uncertain times. Pandemic aside, the console itself is really good. I've hooked it up to the TV a couple of times but I mainly play it handheld. I mainly play Playstation 4 and haven't had a handheld console since the Nintendo 3DS, but so far it's been great. The battery life is decent, definitely better than what I have had before and it charges pretty quickly either docked or with the charger. It's comfortable to hold despite the size of it but I'd recommend taking breaks if you're playing for long periods as it can be straining on your hands. But other than that it's a great console and there a great range of games for it.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2020
5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't go wrong.,Verified Purchase,"Son wanted Nintendo Switch for Xmas, so son received Nintendo Switch. Kids seem to know what they want these days. We haven't seen much of him since then, but I guess that's the price one has to pay. Anyway, if this is what your kids want, this will make them happy. Beware of future pricy (additional) game requests, and of course an online subscription (as one does these days). It is what it is.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 December 2019
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best console on the market,Verified Purchase,Wish the price would drop but you should definitely buy new as the price difference is negligible and you want to avoid stick drift.

As the switch work when hand held I let her play on it and download her games with was downloads. When I contacted to ask if the docking station could be replaced I was told o could return the whole gaming system for a full refund which I didn’t want to do as my daughter had already downloaded her games so she would be losing games if we returned the whole system. The did offer £10 money back which wouldn’t replace a docking station. After a while this increased to £25 however a docking station is £80 to buy.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020

Its a great game machine (I am not a gamer) for my son and has kept him occupied over lockdown. The only thing I will say which is negative is the cost of the actual games they are very expensive and you are looking at around £50 for some of the newer games and more when you have new platforms added to the games you have. Saying all that my son loves it and it is better constructed than the DS console as it seems more substantial in build.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2020

5.0 out of 5 stars,The same but better,,As far as I can tell the only difference between this new model and the old is that the processor has been updated with a more efficient variant. It has the same performance/graphics in games but because it uses less power this means it makes better use of the 4310mAh battery (same as the old model) and gives you a few more hours of gameplay before needing to charge.Apart from battery life everything is the same as the previous model so I won't get into what I'm sure thousands of other reviews say about the Switch. This model is the new standard version so this is the one to get unless you don't mind the lower battery life and find the original model at a good price.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 September 2019
3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good system, joy con design flaw",,This is a great games system but is let down by the joy cons which have a design flaw. Google j'oy con drifting' and see how widespread.  Nintendo are fixing this issue for free in the us but here in the UK you'll need to pay £30 per joy con for the privilege,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2019
2.0 out of 5 stars,Please read before purchasing.,,"I rarely write negative reviews of products, but I feel having had two Nintendo Switches since launch I need to make possible buyers aware of a serious issue.The main problem with this console is the joycons. I own 8 pairs of joycons (due to having a young family) and all bar one set have fallen victim to the ""infinite drift"" fault making them unusable.This wouldn't be so bad if Nintendo UK would honour warranty periods and free repairs available in other territories. Sadly in this case it is only a few months they will repair the joycons for free (as they should). Almost every set of joycons I've had that have started with the drifting have done so just outside the covered period. A £70~£80 product that lasts 7 months on average is just not good enough.The cost for repairing this fault is quoted at £35 (minimum) per individual joycon, so a faulty pair will set you back £70 (the cost of a new set of joycons).I've even purchased new sets of joycons from highstreet retailers that have been faulty on opening.(just to stress, this is not a case of needing recalibration or resyncing, all troubleshooting has always proved worthless)As much as I love Nintendo and have owned every console since the NES the switch has broken my faith in them.If you have a look around online it's clear I'm not just being unlucky here. Please bear this in mind before making a purchase!This may make the newer version of the Switch with inbuilt controls an even riskier purchase.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2019
3.0 out of 5 stars,Great handheld but games cost way more than on other consoles,,"I am happy I bought this console due to some great exclusive titles like mario, yoshi and donkey kong.It is the perfect console to complement the ps4 or xbox for handheld use.If you plan to play mainly through a tv or dont already own a ps4 or xbox, I wouldn't bother though.While the exclusive titles are great, there aren't that many of them and most fairly short. I wouldn't say the exclusive titles are as good as the ps4 exclusives either.My main issue is with the 3rd party titles though. Due to the limited power of the console, they are no where near as good graphically. Furthermore, they all cost twice as much on the switch despite being inferior.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2019
